    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>
      some image would go here, probably my picture as well as some sort of
      blurb about me, my aspirations,
    </p>
    <!-- Sec 1 - About me -->
    <div>
      <p>
        So this is a section about me. How quaint. Now to put some meaningless
        junk into it.

    <!-- Sec 2 - Credentials -->
    <div>
      <p>
        Now to list my Credentials. I've got lots (not really). I'm super
        popular (i wish). I know what I'm doing (thank god for search engines
        and chatGPT). I saw this design where the person listed all the tools
        they were good with. I'd do the same thing but focus on highlighting
        each tool with their own project.
      </p>
      <h3>A LIST!!!</h3>
      <p>
        Best list if I ever saw one. More like testamonials. Or things that can
        prove my abilities. Ya. That.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A ONE!</li>
        <li>A TWO!!</li>
        <li>A THREE!!!!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But there are four exclamation points. How strange.</p>

      <h3>PORTFOLIO PROJECTO BITCHEZ!!!!</h3>
      <!--
        for this, I'd like to showcase 4 technical projects and 3 passion projects. the technical projects are to highlight my skills as:
          - a critical thinker
          - willingness to use different approaches to various problems
          - my creative approach to a solution (assuming i cant figure it out)
          - my view and attempt at solving a worldwide problem (research this and see what that means.)
        
        For the passion projects, i would go with:
          - a digimon vpet path chart. start with the easy versions. its advance form is:
          selecting the model vpet, then selecting its final evolution. this will produce a digimon line chart, detailing how many battles you need, care mistakes, and any items u may need for it. you can edit the evo line, which in turn, will edit the details of what you need to do.
          - pokemon gen 1 and gen 2 database. main focus is to use database language to create and manage pokemon information. I would love to extend this to digimon, if given the chance.
          - something python based. a CYOA seems to be the easiest but I want something with a bit more bang.
          - fun project/exercise: Javascript fidgetoy for mobile.
          - evil fun project/exercise: Javascript fidgettoy for mobile with terrible design specs, like a difficult to use volume button or random interfering objects on selection.
      
        Websites for the sake of example and execution:
          - GA site leading and guiding players to understand how to play the game. this will include general strategies, basics, and card staples for budget and competitive. main focus will be talking about how to pilot various decks. it will talk about the basics of the deck, end goal, overall strategies and key strategies and combos, and end game. it'll also give examples of what a budget deck looks like and what an optimal deck is. 
          - Digimon site talking about what current deck archetypes are, general information on these archetypes, and how to pilot. It'll talk about the basics of the deck, the core of it (staple cards), how to pilot, what the end goal is (strategies you should go for), as well as what a budget and meta competitive deck looks like.
